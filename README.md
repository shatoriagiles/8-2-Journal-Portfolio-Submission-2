# 8-2-Journal-Portfolio-Submission-2

The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted to improve the way people prepare for their driving exams. The client wanted a web-based system that allowed users to sign up for driving courses, take practice tests, and track their progress. The system also needed to allow administrators and instructors to manage users, update course materials, and view reports. The main goal was to make driver training more accessible and efficient through an online platform.

One thing I did particularly well was clearly defining the system’s requirements and translating them into design diagrams and documentation. I made sure the use case diagram, class diagram, and system components were organized and easy to understand. I also focused on showing how different parts of the system interact, which helped make the design more realistic and practical.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the section describing the non-functional requirements, such as performance and security. While I mentioned them briefly, I could have gone into more detail about how the system would protect user data, handle multiple users at once, and maintain reliability. I would also add more specific examples of how those requirements could be implemented in code.

To interpret the user’s needs, I reviewed the client’s goals and created use cases that represented real-world scenarios such as a student registering for a class or an instructor updating test materials. By mapping out these actions, I ensured the system design matched what users actually needed to do. Considering user needs is extremely important because software must be both useful and easy to navigate. A system can have great features, but if it’s not user-friendly, people won’t use it effectively.

When I approach software design, I like to start by fully understanding the problem before thinking about solutions. I break down requirements into smaller parts, create diagrams to visualize the system, and plan how data will flow between components. In the future, I plan to use more user stories and prototypes to test design ideas early on. I will also focus on using an iterative approach, where feedback is gathered at each stage to make improvements continuously.

Overall, this project helped me strengthen my ability to design software systems that meet user and business needs. It also showed me the importance of planning, documentation, and keeping the end user in mind throughout the design process.
